images
----------------
if an image upload was unsuccessful, force user to delete it
	don't show dzone until errors are cleared (can't have them lingering forever, need an event to clear them)
	upon user deleting, check if any other image errors and reset base image error so message can be saved
Can't save message with image errors
delete image


other messages
---------------
If selected category is All, get all messages
validate against empty tag key throughout - not what's done already
optimize error handling
re-label? and show required for form fields
edit message - only if I'm the creator
delete message - only if I'm the creator
if no expiration date, set to 180 days in future
