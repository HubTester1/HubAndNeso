                <description>Learn about the exciting world of Traveling Programs by participating in an on-site visit to a local school, library, or camp. GSEs will begin their day by meeting a TP educator at the crack of dawn in the Museum garage, helping load the van in the morning, riding along in a very colorful Museum van through Boston traffic, and checking-in at a local educational institution. Once the educator has finished setting up the program, GSEs can expect to serve as a spectator during the assembly or workshop program, as they witness the ins-and-outs of outreach education first-hand. (Note: Half-day shifts can sometimes run up to 4.25 hours. Full-day shifts are usually around 6 hours.)</description>
