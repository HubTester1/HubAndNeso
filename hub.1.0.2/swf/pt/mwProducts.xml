The walls are opened up to show some unique materials so&#xd;
they can see what it’s made out of. There is the "Skyscraper Area", where visitors are immersed in an environment of bolted&#xd;
steel, glass and concrete. Visitors are given the illusion (with the help of a 3D viewer) of working forty stories above the ground&#xd;
and experience the sensation of looking down the side of a building. Every building has a story to tell, has clues about their age,&#xd;
function and the people who live in them. &#xd;

For thousands of years, humans everywhere—	sometimes inspired by living animals or even fossils—have brought mythic 	creatures to life in stories, songs and works of art. Today these creatures, 	from the powerful dragon to the soaring phoenix, continue to thrill, terrify, 	entertain and inspire us. We seem to catch glimpses of these creatures all 	around us: hiding beneath the ocean waves, running silently through the 	forest and soaring among the clouds. Some symbolize danger. Others, we 	think, can bring us luck or joy. Together mythic creatures give shape to 	humankind's greatest hopes, fears and most passionate dreams.&#xd;
		The exhibit is divided into 4 theme areas:&#xd;
	Water - Creatures of the Deep &#xd;
This section contains the topics: sea monsters in cultures around the world, information on real animals like the giant squid which many sea monsters may be based on, the depiction of mythic killer whales in Nazca culture (Peru 1 -700 AD), mermaid myths, discussion on how legends of mythic creatures have changed through cultural interaction &amp; through the course of time, &amp; the Chinese water dragon.&#xd;
	Land – Creatures of the Earth&#xd;
This section contains the topics: How fossils have inspired mythical creatures, the griffin &amp; dinosaur fossils, giants &amp; Cyclopes in Greek mythology &amp; fossils that may have spurred these legends, Unicorns &amp; narwhal tusks, bringing mythic creatures to life through cultural reenactments, modern mythic creatures like the chupacabra &amp; Bigfoot, &amp; depictions of land dragons in different cultures.&#xd;

These factors combine to make flying impractical for the majority of the private general aviation community.&#xd;
Terrafugia Inc. is developing the Transition® Personal Air Vehicle, a novel aircraft that is capable of folding its wings, driving on the highway, and parking in a standard garage. The Transition® allows pilots to drive when the weather is bad, giving them tremendous transportation flexibility. It saves money on both gasoline and hangar rental, and it provides pilots with a ride wherever they might land, saving time and hassle, while reducing their impact on the environment.  The Terrafugia Transition® will transform personal aviation for tens of thousands of pilots around the world.&#xd;
The exhibit will consist of a prototype of the Terrafugia Transition Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) with brief explanatory signage. &#xd;

Although most people have no aversion to frogs, their beauty and elegance are often overlooked. These amphibians are among the most visually stunning, vocally pleasing and adaptively remarkable life forms on earth. If you’ve never thought of frogs as beautiful, this exhibition will change your mind!&#xd;
	&#xd;
Frogs – A Chorus of Colors is designed to transform an exhibit gallery and offer visitors the feel of a frog’s world. Stunning backlighted graphic panels with colorful images by Joe McDonald, Dave Northcott, John Netherton, Bill Love and other renowned wildlife photographers cover the walls of the exhibition island. Frog habitats, complete with rock ledges, live plants and waterfalls, protrude through the island walls. Living frogs from around the world offer a glimpse of the vast pallet of frog diversity. Sturdy interactive 	components invite visitors to activate recorded frog calls, touch models, view videos of frogs in action, spin a zoetrope, and test frog knowledge on subjects from basic to bizarre. Throughout the exhibition visitors are immersed in the sights and sounds of frogs.&#xd;
&#xd;
The exhibition includes 15 frog habitats complete with naturalistic decor, filtration and life support systems; 12 interactive components; and over 35 backlighted informative panels.&#xd;

Edward Burtynsky's imagery explores the intricate connection between industry and nature; combining the raw elements of mining, quarrying, manufacturing, shipping, oil production and recycling into eloquent, highly expressive visions that find beauty and humanity in the most unlikely of places.&#xd;
&#xd;
Artist’s Statement:&#xd;
Nature transformed through industry is a predominant theme in my work. I set course to intersect with a contemporary view of the great ages of man; from stone, to minerals, oil, transportation, silicon, and so on. To make these ideas visible I search for subjects that are rich in detail and scale yet open in their meaning. Recycling yards, mine tailings, quarries and refineries are all places that are outside of our normal experience, yet we partake of their output on a daily basis.&#xd;
&#xd;
These images are meant as metaphors to the dilemma of our modern existence; they search for a dialogue between attraction and repulsion, seduction and fear. We are drawn by desire - a chance at good living, yet we are consciously or unconsciously aware that the world is suffering for our success. Our dependence on nature to provide the materials for our consumption and our concern for the health of our planet sets us into an uneasy contradiction. For me, these images function as reflecting pools of our times.&#xd;

	&#xd;
Black holes are an ideal vehicle for engaging the public in exploring the 	nature of science—including the idea that extraordinary claims require 	extraordinary evidence, and the wonderful idea that nature can be much 	stranger than our intuitions would guess.  Advances in exhibitry and 	scientific visualizations have now made it possible for visitors to explore even the strangest ideas underlying black holes and the extremes of 	gravity, in a variety of sensory modalities.  At the same time, much of the 	evidence for black holes is both dramatic and accessible to general audiences—making it possible for the public to weigh for themselves 	whether black holes have moved from the realm of science fiction to the 	status of reality.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this exhibit you’ll combine the roles of scientist, explorer, and reporter as you take on a challenging mission—to find out the inside story of black holes.  Do they really exist?  Are they friend or foe (or both)?  What’s the 	fuss and why are they considered so exciting?  What’s so mysterious 	about them?  You’ll have the opportunity to capture your experiences and 	observations for later reference, because the exhibit will automatically 	create a personalized website for you.&#xd;
&#xd;
You'll find three areas in this exhibit:  An introductory area will help orient you to the new world of black holes. An exploration area offers you hands-on opportunities to investigate the latest evidence, images, and theories about these mysterious beasts, with the video-based assistance of both scientist and teen guides.  And the black hole mission area will provide the signature experience of this exhibit, a virtual journey to the black hole at the center of our galaxy.  &#xd;

Each image portrays a specific quantity of something: fifteen million sheets of office paper (five minutes of paper use); 106,000 aluminum cans (thirty seconds of can consumption) and so on. Statistics can feel abstract and anesthetizing, making it difficult to connect with and make meaning of large numbers.  This project visually examines these vast and bizarre measures of our society, in large intricately detailed prints assembled from thousands of smaller photographs.   The goal is that images representing these quantities might have a different effect than the raw numbers alone.&#xd;
&#xd;
The version of this exhibit to be displayed at the Museum of Science will contain 7 distinct prints.  Details below:&#xd;
&#xd;
Gyre (96x44” x 3 panels)	Depicts 2.4 million pieces of plastic, equal to the estimated number of pounds of plastic pollution that enter the world's oceans every hour. All of the plastic in this image was collected from the Pacific Ocean.&#xd;
	&#xd;
Plastic Cups (60x90”)&#xd;
Depicts one million plastic cups, the number used on airline flights in the US every six hours.&#xd;
	&#xd;
Cans Seurat (60x92”)		Depicts 106,000 aluminum cans, the number used in the US every thirty seconds.&#xd;
&#xd;
Cell Phones (60x100”)&#xd;
Depicts 426,000 cell phones, equal to the number of cell phones retired in the US every day.&#xd;
                  &#xd;
Jet Trails (60x96”) &#xd;
Depicts 11,000 jet trails, equal to the number of commercial flights in the US every eight hours.                           &#xd;
&#xd;

The exhibit contains 4 sub-sections:&#xd;
Introduction: Visitors to the exhibit are welcomed into the underwater 		world of whales&#xd;
Whale People: In this section, visitors meet some of the people whose 		lives have been inextricably linked with whales – from legendary South Pacific whale riders, to whale scientists and former whaling families.  It explores the changing attitudes to whales &amp; whaling.		Whale Lab: In the Whale Lab visitors can explore the biology of whales and find out about their extraordinary lifestyles – from some of the smallest dolphins to the mightiest creature on Earth		Strandings: This section explores the mystery of whale strandings, both 		mass and single strandings, and explores how people respond to whale strandings.  For some, stranded whales are gifts from the sea.  For others, they are rare opportunities to study these creatures.  And many people want to help save them.&#xd;

Today, some 400 years after Galileo created his, modern telescopes have enabled us to “see” what the human eye cannot. This new generation of ground- and space-based telescopes has created an explosion of images for the public to explore.&#xd;
&#xd;
The exhibit includes 6 astronomical Images &amp; 1 banner as well as a research component where, at select times, visitors will be surveyed onsite.  This survey will study visitors’ perceptions of multi-wavelength astronomical imagery and the effects of the scientific and artistic choices in processing astronomical data. The images come from a variety of space and ground-based observatories, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, the Very Large Array, the Hinode satellite, and many others. Evaluation of such valuable data will benefit astronomy across the electromagnetic spectrum of astronomical images, and may help visualization of data in other scientific disciplines.  &#xd;

Carver’s Mighty Mission:&#xd;
George Washington Carver envisioned a world of peace and prosperity that could be fulfilled through exploring and investigating nature.  A brief introductory text panel and video explain that Dr. Carver was a complex and fascinating individual whose contributions extend far beyond his notable work with peanuts, and whose teachings have special relevance to problems faced by the world today.  Visitors can discover George Washington Carver’s life an achievements, beginning with the amazing story of his earliest days.&#xd;
&#xd;
From Slave to Scholar:&#xd;
Born a slave, orphaned as an infant and plagued by ill health, Dr. carver overcame enormous obstacles.  This section recounts the story of Dr. Carver’s childhood, including his dramatic rescue from slave raiders, early signs of genius, and 20-year quest for education.&#xd;
&#xd;
People’s Scientist:&#xd;
Dr. Carver’s life’s work was dedicated to “helping the man lowest down.”  It was because of his dedication to service that he chose to leave the abundant resources of Iowa State College for Tuskegee Institute, where he focused his research on topics that would improve the lives of farmers.  Upon arriving in Alabama and seeing the “acres of scraggly cotton,” Dr. Carver immediately knew what was wrong with Southern soil – and how to fix it.  The focus point of this section and symbol of his lifelong commitment to humanitarian goals is a life-size reproduction of the original Jesup wagon, a school on wheels designed by Dr. Carver.&#xd;
&#xd;
Plant Power:&#xd;
This section recreated Dr. Carver’s lab to help tell the story of his experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other plants.&#xd;
&#xd;
Carver’s Legacy:&#xd;
The closing section of the exhibition explores Dr. Carver’s scientific and lifelong humanitarian legacy.  This section will feature contemporary research in medicinal plants, bio-products, and fuels, including studies now underway at the Carver Agricultural Research Station at Tuskegee University.  This section also touches on Dr. Carver’s exemplary lifestyle – his discipline, hobbies, and eccentricities that endeared him to the general public.  Dr. Carver saw all of his disparate activities and endeavors as part of a singular quest for truth and understanding of the world.  His unique worldview and the example of his life are perhaps his most powerful legacy.&#xd;

&#xd;
How are laser beams created? Where can we find lasers in everyday life? How can a laser make light appear around corner? These are just a few of the questions that the LaserLab playfully answers for visitors through 7 interactive exhibit components.&#xd;
&#xd;
A laser foosball table is a highlight of the LaserLab. Visitors can put their newly-acquired understanding of lasers to use. The laser foosball game works just like normal foosball. But the ball is a laser beam that has to be directed into the goal with the help of adjustable mirrors.&#xd;

Throughout history, these differences have been a source of community strength and personal identity. They 	have also been the basis for discrimination and oppression.&#xd;
	&#xd;
The idea of "race" has been used historically to describe these differences 	and justify mistreatment of people and even genocide. Today, contemporary scientific understanding of human variation is beginning to challenge "racial" differences, and even question the very concept of race.&#xd;
&#xd;
RACE: Are We So Different?, developed by the American Anthropological 	Association in collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota, is the 	first national exhibition to tell the stories of race from the biological, 	cultural, and historical points of view. Combining these perspectives offers 	an unprecedented look at race and racism in the United States.&#xd;

These simplifications stand in marked contrast to the rich and complex ways in which we identify ourselves, our neighborhoods, and our hometowns. Boston’s long history of diversity and change is unknown to many and often overshadowed by well-known periods of racial tension and conflict. Today, the Greater Boston area is home to a wealth of ethnicities and cultures, a vivid tapestry exemplified in the neighborhoods along Route 28, which stretches from country to the north, through suburbs and manufacturing towns, past the Museum and through the heart of Boston, and down to Cape Cod.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Sound artist Halsey Burgund and the Museum of Science collected the voices of over 250 people who live along the Route 28 corridor. The result is Voices Without Faces, Voices Without Races, a compelling collage of personal stories that reveal how we are all different and how we are the same. &#xd;

Ever since the first dinosaur fossil was identified almost 200 years ago, people have wondered how these fascinating animals lived, moved and behaved. At first, dinosaur hunters used only such tools as a keen eye, shovels and compasses. Today, scientists also rely on everything from satellite technology to scanning electron microscopes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Prepare to take a journey of discovery into the exciting world of modern paleontology. New dinosaur fossils are being discovered faster than ever before. Advanced technology allows scientists to look at these fossils in fresh ways. And researchers are gaining surprising insights into these amazing animals. New discoveries, new technology and new ideas are helping today's scientists piece together what these living, breathing dinosaurs were really like.  The exhibit is separated into 5 theme sections; 	Introduction, How Dinosaurs Moved, How Dinosaurs Behaved, The Liaoning Forest, and Extinction.&#xd;

Sometimes scary, but always intriguing, darkeness beckons exploration.  Darkness is also a natural evolutionary selective pressure that has caused plants and animals to adapt to dark ecosystems like caves, the deep sea, the forest at night, and underneath the ground.&#xd;
	Since prehistoric times humans have sought to understand the function of darkness, and have invented ways to change it.  Guests explore and so9lve some of these mysteries of the dark using electronic, mechanical and computer interactives, walkthrough or around dioramas, fiberglass models, and graphic panels.&#xd;
Theme Areas:&#xd;
The Darkness of Night  (Nocturnal Environments) – Through dioramas &amp; 	interactives, visitors explore nocturnal animals in three different habitats, 	the great Smoky Mountains, the Sonoran Desert, and a Louisiana cypress 	swamp. &#xd;
Darkness within the Soil (Underground Environments) – Focusing attention 	closer to home, the exhibit takes a look at the soil beneath human feet.  A 	cross-section of a backyard reveals it to be teaming with life such as 	moles, termites, cicadas, worms, and slugs living within the seemingly 	solid substrate.&#xd;
Darkness Deep within Caves (Caverns) – caves offer a refuge that is completely 	without light.  Guests receive a dramatic introduction to one type of cave 	as they walk through a recreation of a Kentucky cave formed by the slow 	action of water dissolving the limestone over millennia.  This cavern is 	inhabited both by animals looking for temporary  darkness during the day, 		such as bats, and by animals whose ancestors wandered deeper into the 	cave and never re-emerged, such as blind cave fish, cave flatworms and 	cave crayfish.&#xd;
Darkness of the Deep Sea (Deep Sea Environments) – This area of the exhibit 	plummets into the depths of the sea, offering a glimpse of an environment		that I not only eternally dark, but that does not even depend on the world 	of light for its source of energy.  This area of the exhibit explores animals 	that thrive near sulfur vents, by feeding on bacteria, and those that survive 	by feeding off of the photosynthetic plankton that drift down from the area 	of light.  &#xd;
Darkness and Humans (Humans in the Dark) – In an urban residential setting, 	the exhibit examines the interaction of humans with darkness.  Guests		can explore myths and legends of different human cultures to interpret 	night and darkness as well as technological adaptations to the dark, 	including technologies developed to assist the blind. &#xd;

Virtually untouched for over 1,700 years, the city and the remains of its inhabitants were sealed in a time capsule—a lost civilization and one of the greatest archaeological treasures ever unearthed. Pompeii’s rediscovery – building by building, street by street, block by block –provided historians a rare look at an ancient Roman townscape unchanged over the centuries. &#xd;
&#xd;
Now Museum of Science visitors can experience the life and death of this ancient Roman city in the traveling exhibit A Day in Pompeii. For the first time ever in Boston, more than 250 artifacts—exceptional objects that lay buried in Pompeii's ruins, including room-size frescoes, marble and bronze sculptures, jewelry, gold coins, and everyday household items--are on display. All evoke the richness, culture, and bustle of daily life in the Roman Empire’s favorite vacation resort, situated near Italy’s beautiful Amalfi Coast. Visitors can also examine casts of the volcano's victims, frozen in their last moments, and discover the power of volcanoes past and present.&#xd;
&#xd;
Pompeii is a once-in-a-lifetime experience giving visitors a chance to walk the streets and discover the treasures of a city steeped in legend and mystery.&#xd;

They range from shadowy nighttime hunters with unbelievable camouflage to neon-colored nectar eaters that scamper around in daylight. Bulging eyes, night vision, ‘sticky’ toepads, squawking voices and disposable body parts–welcome to a gecko’s world!&#xd;
&#xd;
Geckos are endowed with a charisma that marketing firms can’t resist and audiences can’t ignore. This exhibition introduces visitors to their remarkable diversity with bold backlighted graphics, engaging interactives and living examples from around the world. Lush, naturalistic habitats anchor the exhibit and draw audiences into the geckos’ realm. Visitors can experience gecko night vision, magnify gecko toepads, listen to gecko voices, activate video clips of geckos in action, try to spot camouflaged geckos and build a custom gecko for various environments.&#xd;
&#xd;
Exhibit will include a minimum of 15 species of live geckos.&#xd;

Standing up to 14 feet high at the shoulder, the mammoth migrated across the Bering Land Bridge into a new world of grasslands and predators, humans not least among them. Slightly shorter, more heavily built, and indigenous to North America, the mastodon also marked an imposing presence on the Pleistocene landscape. What was life like for these animals, whose remains invite so much modern fascination and speculation?&#xd;
&#xd;
In The Field Museum's new traveling exhibition, explore the world of mammoths and mastodons through an exciting collection of skeletons, casts, tusks, preserved flesh, immersive media, and engaging interactives. Learn to tell the difference between a mammoth and a mastodon, and meet other amazing creatures from the Ice Age landscape such as the saber-toothed cat, giant sloth, and Dire Wolf. Be immersed in a richly animated Ice Age panorama as mammoths lumber toward you out of the forest at dawn; experience the cry of the osprey and hear and see skeins of geese flying overhead. Learn how Clovis point-armed hunters stalked these elephantine prey. Investigate why these incredible species died out, and whether it's possible to clone them today.
