						&quot;More than anything, this photograph was really the
						result of a series of little accidents. After abandoning
						a hike halfway through due to lack of sunlight, we
						subsequently began to make our way back home. As we
						drove through a long stretch of highway, I made the
						decision to nap in the back, but before that, for
						whatever reason, I peered out the window and into
						the heavens first. At that point, I began screaming
						like a madman telling everyone to look up. Amazed,
						we pulled into the next rest stop.&quot;
