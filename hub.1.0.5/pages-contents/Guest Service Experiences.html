<p>This is the next phase of the Guest Service Program, providing you with a variety of opportunities to serve our
	visitors and colleagues, putting skills learned in the GSO I and II to use. You will have a chance to work within
	different departments, with new colleagues, perhaps learn something new about the Museum, and have fun trying
	something different.</p>
<p>Participation in the program is a Museum expectation and a factor in the Performance Evaluation Process. To be
	eligible, you must have worked in the Museum for six (6) months, have attended the Guest Service Orientation I &amp;
	II, and:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are full-time (30 or more hrs./week) staff,&#160;you are expected to participate&#160;2 full days/year.
	</li>
	<li>If you are part-time (between 17Â½ -29 hrs./wk) staff,&#160;you are expected to participate for&#160;1
		day/year.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>You may work in a department different from your own, and schedules are both half day (3.5 hour) and full day (7
	hour) segments.</p>
<p>If you have been employed for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Nine months or more, 2 days must be completed or scheduled by June 30th.</li>
	<li>More than five months, but less than nine months, 1 day must be completed or scheduled by June 30th.</li>
</ul>
<p>Posting GSE jobs requires HR&#39;s approval and compliance with
	<a href="/HRDocs/GSE%20Guidelines.docx" target="_blank">these guidelines</a>. If you are creating a Guest Service
	Experience and have questions about whether or not it qualifies for this program, please contact the Human Resources
	Coordinator at X0121. Please be prepared to explain how the experience meets the goal of the Guest Service Program.
