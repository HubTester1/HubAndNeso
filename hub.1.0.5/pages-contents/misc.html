<p>Due to recent events, we would like to provide staff across the Museum a way to collaborate, support and learn from
	one another. We’ve repurposed the GSE calendar so employees can post a variety of opportunities, meet ups, projects,
	and/or lessons. Do you need help with a project? Or maybe a thought partner to get a different perspective? Would
	you be willing to speak with employees who are interested in your career? Lead a virtual Coffee Talk? Offer a book
	club? Or teach a lesson? You can post these opportunities to the calendar so other staff can participate and be
	engaged.</p>

<p>These opportunities no longer have to be half or full day projects; they can be for any length of time.</p>

<p>When you post, you'll need to specify the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li>How many staff members can participate?</li>
	<li>Are any special skills required?</li>
	<li>Are there any physical requirements?</li>
	<li>Is this an onsite or offsite (virtual) opportunity?
		<ul>
			<li>If onsite, please reserve a conference room large enough to accommodate social distancing.</li>
			<li>If virtual, please invite all attendees via Microsoft Teams. (The IT Service Desk can help with this: x0130 / (617) 589-0130.)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this platform, we can also set up affinity groups. An affinity group is a group of people having a common
	interest or goal or acting together for a specific purpose. They may also be called an “employee resource group”.
	These groups can be anything from book clubs, support groups, or where employees share a common interest. They’re
	often the most effective when the group is focused on a creating a diverse and inclusive workplace.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>If you are interested in starting an affinity group, please email <a
		href="mailto:hienello@mos.org">Hayley Ienello</a>. Affinity
	groups will be vetted by HR to ensure there’s as little overlap as possible. Affinity group meeting times will be
	posted on the GSE Calendar and interested employees can sign up to join.</p>

<p>
	For opportunities that are not affinity groups, begin by creating a 
	<a href="bmos.sharepoint.com/sites/hr-service-jobs/SitePages/App.aspx">GSE Job Request</a>. Next, you'll create a 
	<a href="https://bmos.sharepoint.com/sites/hr-service-schedules/SitePages/App.aspx">GSE Schedule</a> for your Job. When
	the scheduled time has passed, return to the schedule to grant credit
	to those who participated.
