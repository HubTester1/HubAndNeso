This has enabled the Museum to improve how we manage, store and backup much of our unstructured content.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare for the final migration of data to the new device we ask that users close out of all shared museum file directories and personal work drives on the night of June 12th before 6pm so that IT can work with Dell EMC and maximize our final migration window. If files and folders are not closed out, IT will close them to ensure that the data is properly migrated to the new device.  To avoid losing changes to files please close out of all files and folders promptly before 6pm.\r\n\r\nThis maintenance is necessary to perform upgrades to our network and system infrastructure. We anticipate this scheduled outage will take approximately 4 to 6 hrs. to complete due to the storage migration of Zeus. During this maintenance window you may experience brief outages where servers, business applications, and or files may not be accessible both internally and externally. To ensure uptime and stability of our platform, we are performing this upgrade shortly after close of business so we can maximize our efforts to ensure business operations will not be impacted when we open the next day. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns please contact the Service Desk team at x0130. \r\n\r\nWe thank you in advance for your attention and understanding.",

			"We just generated a new comment card report from Apr. 23, 2018 to June 5, 2018.\r\nComment Cards- 4\/23\/18-6\/5\/18 Part 2\r\n\r\n�For the Foucault Pendulum, since some energy is constantly being lost to hitting the pegs and to air friction, does the pendulum energy need to have energy applied back in to the pendulum's motion?�\r\n\r\n�The caf� floor and tables, especially near the windows facing the river, are always dirty with food and food and utensils lying around most times we come. Can you please have these surfaces cleaned more often? We sat down for a snack at about 10 AM this morning before most people even use the caf� was cleared it hadn�t been cleaned since at least the day before.�\r\n\r\n�It would be nice to create an App for visiting.�\r\n\r\n�Linda at Omni went 110% out of her way. We were sitting in a bottom row of the theater. She came down all those stairs before and advised us to much better seats. Thank you.�\r\n\r\n�Omni intro: I love that you kept Leonard Nimoy's voice, but please consider replacing the car crash\/police car segment. Without the original video, it's out of context and could be upsetting. Maybe use a shuttle launch or plane overflight?\"\r\n\r\n�Please play Dave Matthews Experience.�\r\n\r\n�Question for you: Is the Annual Report recyclable? It�s a weird material, so I�m not sure. If not, even though it�s unusuab and attention-catching, it wasn�t a goodidea!�\r\n\r\n�I just learned about a chamber music piece by Bruce Adolphe called Tyrannosaurus Sue: A Cretaceous Concerto. Apparently it has been performed around the country. sometimes in conjunction with the actual Sue on tour. Your institution seems like the perfect venue for a performance.�\r\n\r\n�We are long time members of the museum and enjoy using our reciprocity. We are currently visiting the Orlando Science Center. They have a temporary exhibit called Hall of Heroes. My kids loved it and would love to spend more time exploring this exhibit. We think it would the exhibit. We think it would make a great addition to the MOS at some point in time. Not sure where t direct our suggestion, but hope it finds it way to the right person.�\r\n\r\n� My family are members of the museum. I brought my preschooler to the museum today. When we went to use the restroom, the hand dryers were so loud that my child would not go. Is there something that can be done to reduce the\r\nnoise level? I would like my child to be able to go to the museum without an accident. Thank you.�\r\n\r\n�The earth is missing! The earth model from the Museum's Community Solar System is no longer at the Sonesta Hotel. Please replace it?�\r\n\r\n�Me and my Mother had so much fun!�\r\n\r\n�I have listened to Leonard Nimoy for 40 years in Omni. No one knows who he is anymore. Once he left Boston we never heard from him. Re-do with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who love Boston and keep coming back! Mark Walberg is also\r\nmore relevant.�\r\n\r\n�I had an incredible experience watching the particle decay patterns in the cloud chamber. Ted kept me captivated for almost an hour with his incredible knowledge of science history. Thank You!�\r\n\r\n�In the Solar House exhibit, I think there is a wire loose inside Position A. It often comes up 0,000 but if you hit it, it will give you a reading.�\r\n\r\n�To MOS: I just participated in the Eversource Mass Energy Workshop for educators on May 31. The program was incredible and I 100% appreciated being at such a great venue as your 6th floor conference room. The hospitality of the\r\nstaff and the food and beverages provided were great. One thing I was surprised at was that with all the plastic we generated via water bottles and other plastics,\r\nthere was no recycling available. Everything just went into the trash. Does the MOS not have the ability for recycling? Is it too costly and impractical for the numbers of people you service? Aside from that one question, I want to thank you for for hosting programs for teachers such as the one I attended.�\r\n\r\n�I drove an hour to get the museum and arrived a mere 5 minutes late to be turned away from the Beyonce live exhibit. I was 5 minutes late because I went to the bathroom. This is one of my favorite museums but I am disappointed with the inflexible policy. This experience has left me feeling negative especially since it is\r\nrare that I am available to drive into Boston. #disappointed�\r\n\r\n�I recently took my class of 23 students to the museum on a field trip. The students thoroughly enjoyed the museum but all staff we encountered could have been more helpful. Everyone we encountered seemed annoyed that they were on \"\"field trip duty\"\" and things like transitioning from our lunch spot back to the museum were confusing (for storage of the coolers we brought) and when we asked, were given comments in rude tones. While I understand that managing groups of children in a museum can be difficult and not everyone's cup of tea, I do have a problem with people not modeling appropriate social conduct in front of my students--if I ask you a question and my students pick up on your rude behavior, how can I defend your actions?v This ranged from check in, to lunch, to asking the info desk questions (to which the info desk was even helpful when we asked were a certain exhibit was in the museum).�\r\n\r\n�I was disappointed that I drove an hour to arrive a mere 5 minutes late and notable to see the Beyonce experience show. I was slightly late due to the fact that I had to use the bathrooms. I was disappointed with the inflexible policy and now I am not sure if I can make another show. This museum is one of my favorites but this experience has definitely left me feeling negative.�\r\n\r\n\"Horrified and Offended by Beyonce Experience. 80% of the music was edited but shocked by the words being played. No posting in the Museum that show was 18+.�\r\n\r\n�Hi there - we are members and I just wanted to say how much my kids have enjoyed the Dora exhibit. It has been wonderful having an activity that toddlers can take part in - my 2 year old son asks to go every day. It would be amazing to\r\ncontinue to offer something for that age group.�",

This is blatantly false.\r\nSecondly, the cancer exhibit neglects in ITS ENTIRETY to address prevention,reversing and curing cancer is DIET. Cancer does not fall from the sky. It is based on a person making perfecting cells. Cells can only be made through GOOD\r\nNUTRITION, and healthy lifestyle choices. Why is this not even touched upon?\r\nChildren, in particular, should know they have choices!�\r\n\r\n�The museum always makes me starry-eyed.�\r\n\r\n�Like, bro, those laws of motion man... there's like... so much gravity to them.�\r\n\r\n�I hope whoever read these cards today has a wonderful day! <3�\r\n\r\n�The museum is wonderful and so is just about everyone who works there!�\r\n\r\n�I still haven�t received the premium membership of 2 even after I directly paid in person for our membership and visit. Please check and send it asap.�\r\n\r\n�Please PLEASE look into In Saturn's Rings..!�\r\n\r\n�Looking to purchase B & W Alaska photos. Like we did in the 80's ! Is this still available ? Thank You�\r\n\r\n�We visited the museum and the experience was awesome EXCEPT purchased 2 items at the store for the grandkids. One, the lava lamp, worked on night then quit. I don't have my receipt but do know spent $46.69 total. Is there anyway can\r\nbe reimbursed for the lamp? Lastly loved the mirror maze.. Thank you in\r\nadvance�\r\n\r\n�While normally I have a stress free and great experience at the Museum of Science, today was different. One of the employees was rude to both me and my brother who is special needs. I do understand that there are many signs around\r\nthe butterfly garden that way that you may not touch the butterflies. However,there is not much room in the garden allowing for room to walk around. We were yelled at about touching butterflies, but had only disturbed a couple of plants by moving over for people. The other employees were so nice.\r\n\r\n�on 5\/3 can't seem to get tickets into cart�\r\n\r\n�So you have passes for the Journey to the South Pacific IMAX showing on Sunday evening for members - these were made available at 11AM today. Here it is not even 2PM and I've been informed that they sold out by noon. Wow, thanks a lot.\r\nSo if someone is working & in meetings they're out of luck I guess. I don't think I'll be renewing it when it expires at the end of this month.�\r\n\r\n�Please consider toilet seat covers. The flush sends a whirlwind of bacteria 10 feet in all directions. Otherwise, I love this Museum.\"\r\n\r\n�I really enjoyed the whole Museum except the Mirror Maze was too small.\"\r\n\r\n�We miss the Weather Exhibit in the electricity wing. Also, my boys miss the running exhibit at the playground.\"\r\n\r\n�More ink in stamps. Darker skin tones hard to see.\"\r\n\r\n�Hello, My family visited the museum this past Monday and had a wonderful time! I wanted to share a really exceptional interaction between my sons (2 and 4yrs) and Carol from the Discovery Room. She was so enthusiastic and answered\r\nall of my sons� questions showing them all kinds of amazing items. My 4yr old is obsessed with prehistoric sharks and was beyond happy to hold a Megladon tooth and see how big they would have been. When he returned to preschool yesterday he ran up to his teacher to tell her what he saw �I met this really nice lady who made the trip special...� Thank you to Carol who did in fact make our trip special!\r\n:)�\r\n\r\n�I recently took my 4 year old for her first trip to the Museum of Science. We had\r\na wonderful time, but I especially wanted to share how much we enjoyed the temporary Dora & Diego exhibit. We don't watch Dora, but the exhibit was small and perfect for kids her age. There were seats for the adults so we could sit and\r\nobserve while the kids had fun - my girl played with other kids and had a wonderful time. It is a small exhibit but we were there for at least an hour. The staff suggested I let you know how much we enjoyed it. Many thanks.�\r\n\r\n�Just wondering if the free Omni passes that you get each year with membership ever expire?\"\r\n\r\n�We had so much fun on our visit to MoS on Friday May 18th and we wanted to say how grateful we were to Carol, one of your amazing Educators that made sure our visit with my little one was great. When we were in the Discovery Area, she reminded us about the Dora and Diego exhibit which sure was a hit with my five year old. Imagine our surprise when Carol popped up at that exhibit after we had\r\nmade a stop for lunch in your cafeteria. She was so knowledgeable about all the exhibits and the new ones that will be coming this summer, she sure made us realize it was time to get our Family Membership. See you all this Summer.�\r\n\r\n�Years ago I saw a movie at the IMAX theater with some wonderful footage from the Space Shuttle. I believe it was \"\"The Dream is Alive\"\" from what I find on the web. Personally, this was the best IMAX movie I had ever seen mainly because it fits that theater format so perfectly. Is there any chance you will bring this back\r\nfor a new showing?�",

			"Final Museum Storage Migration 6\/12\/18 6pm",
			"Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nAs previously communicated, the Museum, and in particular EiE, received a donation from Dell EMC for a new storage device.  This has enabled the Museum to improve how we manage, store and backup much of our unstructured content. \r\n \r\nWhat Does This Mean?\r\nInformation Technology will use the new device to replace our existing Zeus file server.  After a successful pilot over the past few months, we will finalize the migration of all Zeus shared folders and home directories on our regularly scheduled June Maintenance night on 6\/12 starting at 6pm. \r\n \r\nWhat Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?\r\nDo not panic! We will be retaining all file and folder permissions and will be retaining the existing �Zeus� naming convention in order to maintain how users currently connect to shared resources.\r\n \r\nFor PC\/Windows users, this will not introduce any changes to the way you connect to your Zeus shares.  However, Mac users that do not currently connect to Zeus via the SMB connection (i.e CIFS) will need to be remapped on the morning of 6\/13\/18 in order to access the shares.  Our service desk will be ready to help with this change and you should contact us immediately for assistance.\r\n \r\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\r\nIn order to prepare for the final migration of data to the new device we ask that users close out of all shared museum file directories and personal work drives on the night of June 12th before 6pm so that IT can work with Dell EMC and maximize our final migration window.  If files and folders are not closed out, IT will close them to ensure that the data is properly migrated to the new device.  To avoid losing changes to files please close out of all files and folders promptly before 6pm.\r\n\r\nPlease note that staff should not store non-work related items (music, personal photos, videos, etc.) on Zeus shared museum file directories and home directories, in keeping with the Museum�s Technology Resource Policy. This will help us keep up with the demand for storage needs and retain a longer backup retention policy for museum related work needs.  In the future, if you need additional storage capacity for your home directory, you can call the service desk or submit a request online.\r\n \r\nAs always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.\r\n \r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPat",

			"Guest Author Richard Munson - Sat 5\/26",
			"This Saturday 5\/26 at 11:30, we will have author Richard Munson at the CS&T Stage promoting his new book 'Tesla: Inventor of the Modern'. Come by and hear all about Nikola Telsa's life and accomplishments!\r\n\r\n\"Tesla�s inventions transformed our world, and his visions have continued to inspire great minds for generations.\r\n\r\nNikola Tesla invented the radio, robots, and remote control. His electric induction motors run our appliances and factories, yet he has been largely overlooked by history. In Tesla, Richard Munson presents a comprehensive portrait of this farsighted and underappreciated mastermind.\r\n\r\nWhen his first breakthrough�alternating current, the basis of the electric grid�pitted him against Thomas Edison�s direct-current empire, Tesla�s superior technology prevailed. Unfortunately, he had little business sense and could not capitalize on this success. His most advanced ideas went unrecognized for decades: forty years in the case of the radio patent, longer still for his ideas on laser beam technology. Although penniless during his later years, he never stopped imagining. In the early 1900s, he designed plans for cell phones, the Internet, death-ray weapons, and interstellar communications. His ideas have lived on to shape the modern economy.\r\n\r\nWho was this genius? Drawing on letters, technical notebooks, and other primary sources, Munson pieces together the magnificently bizarre personal life and mental habits of the enigmatic inventor. Born during a lightning storm at midnight, Tesla died alone in a New York City hotel. He was an acute germaphobe who never shook hands and required nine napkins when he sat down to dinner. Strikingly handsome and impeccably dressed, he spoke eight languages and could recite entire books from memory. Yet Tesla�s most famous inventions were not the product of fastidiousness or linear thought but of a mind fueled by both the humanities and sciences: he conceived the induction motor while walking through a park and reciting Goethe�s Faust.\r\n\r\nTesla worked tirelessly to offer electric power to the world, to introduce automatons that would reduce life�s drudgery, and to develop machines that might one day abolish war. His story is a reminder that technology can transcend the marketplace and that profit is not the only motivation for invention. This clear, authoritative, and highly readable biography takes account of all phases of Tesla�s remarkable life.",

This is a step towards evolving what was the IT Help Desk into a larger team of first responders to address your various computing and system needs.  The team will be led by Tony Farrand, who will be joining the Museum on June 4th as a new manager. <p>\r\nWith Tony�s arrival, Amy Gallant and Allie Curtis, both of whom have coordinated the previous Help Desk, will now transition fully to their new positions.  Amy has taken on the role of IT Business Analyst, working with departments across the Museum on both process design and system needs, with a focus on Tessitura.

			"Hi all,\r\n\r\nWe're hosting a Forum event this Tuesday that might be of interest to many of you.  The program is called \"What's In Your Fish?\" and deals with the tradeoffs of neurotoxins in seafood, in the context of the well-known benefits of seafood consumption for brain development in young children and expecting\/recent mothers.  We are co-presenting this event with the Boston University Superfund Research Program (BUSRP), for whom we are a subaward on their federal NIEHS grant.  We developed the forum materials in collaboration with BUSRP partners and a board of advisors from the local EPA office, Massachusetts state regulators, and other kinds of community and scientific experts.\r\n \r\nThe 90-minute Forum event will feature two consecutive case studies, each lasting about 40 minutes.  It�s taking place connected to a conference of Superfund Research Program grantees that will be happening that afternoon here at MOS. First, Kate Crawford from BU will talk about how researchers can assess and communicate risk about toxics in fish and then participants will consider and discuss a local case study about Chelsea Creek, which is part of the Mystic River and has experienced a history of environmental health challenges.  \r\n\r\nThen, Celia Chen, Professor of Environmental Health at Dartmouth College in NH, will present her research about toxics in fish to the public that can impact the particularly vulnerable populations of with young children and pregnant women\/prospective moms.  Participants will then discuss and design a risk advisory for how they would want to be advised of these risks as consumers and community members. \r\n \r\nHere's the link to sign up - the program is free but pre-registration is strongly encouraged.  https:\/\/www.mos.org\/public-events\/whats-in-your-fish.

During the transition day to day operations questions can be directed to Nicole Pugh, Controller at Npugh@Mos.org or (617)589-3183.  For any other questions please reach out to Ed Ancewicz, Sr. Director of Operations at Ed.Ancewicz@WolfgangPuck.com or (561) 313-0163.  And of course please keep me in the loop with any strategic issues related to food service.  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJonathan",

			"Charles River Clean Up Boat GSE�s-New GSE Sign-Up Instructions for This Year!\r\n\r\n**Please read all the way through**\r\n\r\nClean Up Boat Season is here!\r\n\r\nSince 2007 the Museum has partnered with the Charles River Clean Up Boat, a registered 501(c)(3) organization, who�s primary focus is to keep the Charles River clean of floating trash and debris. This organization has done a great job keeping our river beautiful and has received many accolades for its work. \r\n\r\nIn late 2017, the Founder of the Charles River Clean Up Boat, Tom McNichol, passed away after a long battle with cancer. In order to keep the Charles River Clean Up Boat organization going, Boston Duck Tours and the Museum of Science have joined forces to oversee the activities and will help ensure the health of this organization for years to come!\r\n\r\nNEW GSE SIGN-UP PROCESS THIS YEAR\r\n\r\nHow do I sign up?\r\n\r\n**You must complete the following steps in the order listed**\r\n\r\n1. Go to the website- cleanupboat.org.>Click on �Volunteers�>within the first paragraph, click on the word �here� >this will bring you to the volunteer sign up page. \r\n\r\n2. Sign up for an available date, either under the Volunteer 1 or Volunteer 2 fields (please know that the maximum number of Volunteers is now two per day) and then fill in your contact information and select from the drop down, that you are a Museum of Science Employee.\r\n\r\n3. You will receive a confirmation email from �Signup Genius� (Be sure to check your clutter\/junk folders if you don�t see it right away)\r\n\r\n4. Next, sign up for the corresponding GSE through our GSE sign up system.  Please note that the GSE dates listed on the Museum�s GSE sign-up page may not match as being available on cleanupboat.org. This is due to other volunteers, separate from MOS employees, signing up through the cleanupboat.org website. This is why you must sign up on the cleanupboat.org website first.\r\nIf you signed for a shift on cleanupboat.org and notice that there is no corresponding Museum GSE sign up available, please let me know.\r\n\r\nWhat if I need to cancel or reschedule my GSE?\r\n\r\n1. Cancel your GSE using the Museum via the GSE cancellation process.\r\n\r\n2. Go to cleanupboat.org and back to the Volunteer sign up page. Right above where the list of dates begins, you will see a link titled �Already signed up? You can change your sign up.� and follow the instructions from there (I have found that the easiest thing to do is the enter email option and it will email you a link to cancel) Once you have cancelled your day, you will receive a cancellation confirmation email. \r\n\r\nIf you are cancelling your GSE within 3 days of your scheduled date, in addition to canceling on the volunteer page, please contact your Captain directly to let them know.  Captain contact information is located at the top of the volunteer sign-up page.\r\n\r\nRead over the GSE description carefully and be sure to sign up for a day that you know you can commit to. \r\n\r\nThis GSE is fun, rewarding, and on most days, a good way to get out and enjoy the weather!",

The landing zone is anywhere between 43 degrees north latitude and 43 degrees south latitude.\r\n\r\nSatellites of this size don't entirely vaporize when they re-enter the atmosphere, and pieces may survive to impact the Earth's surface.

			"<p>The bomb cyclones just keep on coming - our third storm in less than two weeks produced the highest snow total in the month of March for the city of Boston (14.5\", beating the previous record of 13.2\" from 1956). Some areas of the state got over two feet of snow, and meteorologists are already watching a developing weather pattern that could affect us sometime next week (but that won't pan out...right?!)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While shoveling snow can be good exercise (ALL the Active For Life points!), it can also be dangerous if you don�t plan ahead. One rule of thumb for safe shoveling is to do it early and often � although it can be annoying to constantly shovel, guidelines recommend staying ahead of the storm so that you�re not faced with one insurmountable task of heavy, wet snow to clear, but instead take the time to shovel several times when it will be lighter and more manageable. Check out some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sima.org\/discover-sima\/public-safety\/safety-tips\/safe-snow-shoveling\">other tips for shoveling snow safely<\/a>, brought to you by the Snow & Ice Management Association (yep, apparently that�s a thing).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EUEVoinrtDA\">Stay safe and enjoy the late winter weather!<\/a><\/p>\r\nThe Wellness Team",

			"<p>This Thursday, March 15, Facilities and Public Safety will begin removing the current bike cage in order to install a new one.  Along with an expanded footprint, the new design will feature �hoop� style racks for 32 bikes, lighting, security camera visibility for Public Safety, and badge access. This work will take several weeks and the new bike cage is expected to open Monday, April 2.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to decommissioning the existing structure, it is important that <b>all bikes are removed from the cage before the morning of Thursday, March 15<\/b>. Any bikes left behind will be disposed of by Public Safety. We will be placing two racks temporarily in the area just outside of the current bike cage in the basement level of the garage, in existing motorcycle and EV parking spaces. Given the limited space, we kindly request that you email Mike Sullivan (<a href=\"mailto:msullivan@mos.org\">msullivan@mos.org<\/a>) if you plan on commuting by bike during this time. This will ensure we plan for enough bike parking during the transition. <u>Please also <b>bring a lock<\/b> as this temporary setup will not be cage secured.<\/u> Lastly, please be prepared to park\/lock your bicycles in one of the public racks near the lobby\/rock garden if these temporary racks are full. We appreciate your patience while we work to greatly improve our bike cage facility.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to be able to use the new bike cage with your MOS badge when it is open, you must register information with Public Safety. Although Public Safety and IIT are working to develop a Hub page form to automate this process (similar to the Garage Access form), it is unlikely this will be ready before the new cage is. In the meantime, please e-mail <a href=\"mailto:msullivan@mos.org\">msullivan@mos.org<\/a> with the following information <u>before April 2<\/u> for badge access to the cage:<br>\r\n- Your name<br>\r\n- Your bike make, model, and color<br>\r\n- A contact phone number<br><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please understand this information is only being collected to monitor the safety and security of Museum riders and their bicycles. This will not be public information and will only be used in the event Public Safety needs to reach you. Once the Hub page is active, existing rider information submitted by email will be transferred to the database so you will not need to resubmit anything.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We�re very excited for the enhancements that are being made to our bike cage facility, but apologize for any temporary inconvenience caused by the installation and thank you in advance for your cooperation. Please contact Mike Sullivan at x4495 with any questions\/concerns.<\/p>",

An everyone email will be sent out tomorrow with instructions on how to do this.\r\n\r\nThis maintenance is necessary to perform upgrades to our network and system infrastructure. We anticipate this scheduled outage will take approximately 4 to 6 hrs. to complete. During this maintenance window you may experience brief outages where servers, business applications, and or files may not be accessible both internally and externally. To ensure uptime and stability of our platform, we are performing this upgrade shortly after close of business so we can maximize our efforts to ensure business operations will not be impacted when we open the next day. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns please contact the HD team at x0130. \r\n\r\nWe thank you in advance for your attention and understanding.",

It�s a choose-your-own-adventure style math game for kids 6-8 set in a quirky treehouse castle full of surprises, kid-friendly humor, and pesky elves. We�d like the game to find an audience so it can help even more kids experience math in a fun way. The next stage of the contest taking place now through mid-February considers things like how many people play the game or rate and review it as one factor in determining the winners.

			"On Wednesday, the Moon will be doing a whole lot of interesting things at the same time. Unfortunately, just about none of them will be visible to us in Boston.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the Moon will be full on Wednesday. The moon's distance from us changes very slightly, and this full moon happens to coincide with it being about as close as it gets - what we call a Supermoon. So this full moon will look very slightly larger than usual - but probably nothing you'd notice ordinarily.\r\n\r\nThis full moon also qualifies as a Blue Moon. This can be either the second full moon in a calendar month, or the fourth full moon in a season. Since we had a full moon on Jan. 1st, this will be the twice-a-month variety. This isn't a particularly rare occurrence, and since it's really just a quirk of our calendar, the moon won't appear any different.\r\n\r\nFinally, there will be a lunar eclipse Wednesday. This is when the moon passes through the Earth's shadow. As it does so, light filtering through the Earth's atmosphere falls on it - but only red light, giving it the name Blood Moon. Unfortunately, this is happening just as the moon sets for us here in Boston very early Wednesday morning. By the time it comes back up at sunset, the eclipse will be long over.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it! The Super Blue Blood Moon is getting a lot of air time in the media but it won't be particularly exciting. For a great show, stay tuned for next week's launch of the most powerful rocket in forty years!",

			"Flu Season",
			"You may have noticed in the news that many people are coming down with the Flu.  \r\n\r\n<p>Flu symptoms may include:\r\nFever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches, and fatigue.\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel sick, consider your coworkers and use your sick time to help prevent the spread of germs.  Massachusetts employers are required to offer all employees sick time.  Part-time and non-benefit eligible staff accrue 1 hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.  Full-time benefits eligible staff receive 5 sick days in their first year and 10 sick days each year thereafter.  You may also use your vacation time if necessary.\r\n\r\n<p>Ways to prevent getting the flu:\r\n<li>Get a flu shot - it�s the best way to protect from the flu.<\/li>\r\n<li>Boost your immunity with sleep, good nutrition and hydration.<\/li>\r\n<li>Wash your hands and don�t touch your face.  Carry hand sanitizer, too.<\/li>\r\n<li>Cover your cough.  Cough or sneeze into tissues to contain germs.<\/li>\r\n<li>Wipe down and disinfect frequently touched surfaces to kill germs.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven�t had a flu shot, you should still try and get one! Many doctor offices still offer flu shot clinics, as well as pharmacies and grocery stores. We suggest calling in advance to make sure vaccinations are still available.  Here are some local pharmacies\/retailers that are offering flu shots:  \r\n<p><a href=https:\/\/www.cvs.com\/store-locator\/store-locator-landing.jsp?_requestid=3535421>CVS<\/a>\r\n<p><a href=https:\/\/www.walgreens.com\/pharmacy\/immunization\/immunization_index.jsp>Walgreens<\/a>\r\n<p><a href=https:\/\/www.riteaid.com\/shop\/info\/pharmacy\/services\/vaccine-central >RiteAid<\/a>\r\n<p><a href=https:\/\/stopandshop.com\/rx-services\/>Stop & Shop<\/a>\r\n\r\n<p>The copay amount for the vaccination is dependent on your health insurance coverage.  If you�re a Harvard Pilgrim member, there is no copay at these stores.  As long as the pharmacy is contracted with Harvard Pilgrim, the immunization is covered in full.  All you need to do is ask at the pharmacy if they accept HPHC, which most of them do.  Also, if you�re a Harvard Pilgrim member, don�t forget about their Telemedicine feature <a href=https:\/\/www.doctorondemand.com\/harvard-pilgrim>Doctor On Demand<\/a>.  If you or someone in your family is sick, you can Skype with a medical professional without leaving your house (normal copay applies). \r\n\r\n<p>Don't \"wait and see\" � get help right away. Early flu treatment (within 72 hours of exposure to the virus) has been proven to reduce the length and severity of illness. If you think you might have the flu, or have been exposed to someone with the flu, see a health care professional right away. \r\n\r\n<p>Please protect yourself and your coworkers by taking the necessary precautions and please stay home if you have a fever and don�t feel well.  <u>Staff who have the flu should not return to work until they have been without a fever for 24 hours.",

After the first two sessions, I realized that the program content was proving to be particularly challenging to this group of students and, while they were all capable of completing the activities, they needed additional help in order to reap the full benefits of the workshop. Megan was in the office at the museum that day, and when I asked, she did not hesitate to give up office time to catch up on her own work. She took an Uber to the school, and helped me with the remaining two sessions. She really helped me out in a time when I was feeling overwhelmed, and went out of her way to make sure my students had the best experience possible, and got the extra educator support they needed.�<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: red;\">�<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\">Take time to write a MOScar today.
